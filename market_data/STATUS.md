2. Connection to TradingView requires valid credentials
3. Webhook server needs proper setup and configuration
4. Error handling could be improved

## Usage

To use the Market Data Subsystem, you need to:

1. Initialize the Market Data Manager with proper configuration:
   ```python
   from trading_system.market_data import initialize_market_data
   
   config = {
       "tradingview": {
           "username": "your_tradingview_username",
           "password": "your_tradingview_password",
           "session_token": None,  # Optional session token
           "webhook": {
               "host": "0.0.0.0",  # Listen on all interfaces
               "port": 8080,       # Port for webhook server
               "path": "/webhook/tradingview",  # Webhook endpoint path
               "api_key": "your_secret_key"     # Secret key for webhook authentication
           }
       }
   }
   
   await initialize_market_data(config)
   ```

2. Access market data:
   ```python
   from trading_system.market_data import get_market_data
   
   # Get market data for a symbol and timeframe
   market_data = await get_market_data(symbol="BTC/USDT", timeframe="1D")
   ```

3. Get the latest trading signals:
   ```python
   from trading_system.market_data import get_latest_signals
   
   # Get the latest buy signals for a specific symbol
   signals = await get_latest_signals(symbol="BTC/USDT", signal_type="buy", limit=10)
   ```

4. Configure TradingView alerts to send to your webhook endpoint:
   - Configure alert in TradingView with "Webhook URL" set to your server
   - Format the alert message as JSON with required fields
   - Include the API key in the "X-TradingView-Key" header

## Conclusion

The Market Data Subsystem provides a solid foundation for capturing and processing market data from TradingView. It's designed to be easily extendable while maintaining a clean API for the rest of the system. With proper configuration and the next steps implemented, it will serve as a reliable source of market data for the trading system.
