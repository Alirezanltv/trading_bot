# High-Reliability Crypto Trading System

This document outlines the high-availability and fault-tolerance features of the trading system, designed to provide maximum resilience and reliability for production trading operations.

## Core High-Availability Features

### Component Failover

The system includes a robust component failover mechanism that allows for automatic switching between primary and backup components when failures are detected. Key features include:

- **Active/Passive Failover**: Primary components are backed by standby alternatives that can take over when needed
- **Active/Active Configuration**: Multiple active instances can run simultaneously with load balancing
- **N+1 Redundancy**: System maintains N active components plus 1 spare for immediate failover
- **Cluster Configuration**: Clustered redundancy for critical components

### Health Monitoring

Comprehensive health monitoring tracks the status of all system components:

- **Real-time Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of component health status
- **Custom Health Metrics**: Define custom health checks for specific components
- **Health History**: Record and analyze component health trends over time
- **Automatic Recovery**: Components can automatically recover from failure conditions

### Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling operations that consistently fail:

- **Automatic Circuit Breaking**: Failing operations are automatically disabled after reaching a threshold
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customize failure counts and timeouts for different operations
- **Half-Open State**: Circuit breakers test recovery by allowing a single test operation
- **Fallback Operations**: Provide alternative implementations for critical operations

### System Dashboard

A comprehensive web-based dashboard provides real-time monitoring of system health:

- **Component Status Visualization**: See the status of all system components at a glance
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification of critical issues
- **Health Trend Analysis**: Track system health over time
- **Failover History**: Review automatic and manual failover events
- **Action Controls**: Trigger manual failovers and system resets when needed

## Reliability Enhancements

### Message Bus Resilience

The message bus provides reliable communication between components:

- **RabbitMQ Integration**: Production-grade message broker with durability guarantees
- **Message Persistence**: Critical messages are persisted to disk
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Components automatically reconnect to the message bus after network issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to in-memory mode for development/testing

### Transaction Verification

All critical transactions undergo verification to ensure integrity:

- **Three-Phase Commits**: Pre-commit, commit, and post-commit phases for order execution
- **Transaction Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all transaction steps
- **Reconciliation Service**: Automatic reconciliation with exchange data
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for all transactions

### Data Consistency

The system maintains data consistency across components:

- **Database Transactions**: ACID-compliant database operations
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all incoming data
- **Redundant Data Sources**: Multiple sources for critical market data
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Components automatically synchronize state after recovery

## Deployment Considerations

### Configuration

High-availability features are configurable through the system configuration:

```json
{
  "high_availability": {
    "health_check_interval_seconds": 5,
    "auto_failback": true,
    "failover_groups": {
      "market_data": {
        "mode": "active_passive",
        "components": ["primary_market_data", "backup_market_data"]
      },
      "execution": {
        "mode": "active_passive",
        "components": ["primary_execution", "backup_execution"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Integration

The health monitoring system integrates with external monitoring tools:

- **Prometheus Integration**: Export metrics to Prometheus
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Pre-built Grafana dashboards for system monitoring
- **Alert Webhooks**: Send alerts to external systems via webhooks
- **Email/SMS Notifications**: Configure notifications for critical alerts

## Getting Started

To enable high-availability features:

1. Configure failover groups in `config/system_config.json`
2. Register components with the failover manager during system initialization
3. Implement custom health checks for critical components
4. Start the health dashboard (default port: 8080)

Example component registration:

```python
from trading_system.core.high_availability import get_failover_manager, FailoverMode

# Get failover manager
failover_manager = get_failover_manager()

# Register primary market data component
failover_manager.register_component(
    component_id="primary_market_data",
    component=primary_market_data,
    failover_group="market_data",
    is_primary=True,
    failover_mode=FailoverMode.ACTIVE_PASSIVE
)

# Register backup market data component
failover_manager.register_component(
    component_id="backup_market_data",
    component=backup_market_data,
    failover_group="market_data",
    is_primary=False,
    failover_mode=FailoverMode.ACTIVE_PASSIVE
)

# Start failover manager
failover_manager.start()
```

### Running the Health Dashboard

To start the health dashboard:

```python
from trading_system.monitoring.health_dashboard import create_health_dashboard

# Create and start dashboard
dashboard = create_health_dashboard()
await dashboard.initialize()
await dashboard.start()
```

Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8080
